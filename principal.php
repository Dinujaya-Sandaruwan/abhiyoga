					<p class="post-text"><strong>Welcome to the website of Mayurapada. </strong><br><br>As the present principal of Mayurapada Central College I feel extremely honoured, privileged and delighted to send this message at the official website of our school. <br> <br>
                        We live today in a world that is so very different from the one we grew up in, the one we were educated in. Aristotle once said that “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all”. Even as we import education to match the advancement in technology and globalization, we march our students ahead with moral values and principles. We endeavor constantly to instill these qualities in our students. We pride ourselves to help them grow and develop into sensitive and responsible citizens of the future. <br><br>

                        Education plays an important and vital role in enabling a person to face a real life situation with adequate knowledge. In Mayurapada we are making our best effort to give quality education to our students. It is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectations. I believe in upholding high standards with an absolute commitment to strive to understand and improve the quality of education process, using team strategies, while centering on student achievement. <br><br>

                        The aim of our school is to help our students to grow into fine human beings who are capable to face the challenges of the present world. Therefore, student academic and social growth will continue to be our focus. As the principal, I will support and guide teachers and staff in providing the best educational setting for our students. I look forward to working together to continue the successful work at Mayurapada. We give lot of importance to make discipline a core value, encourage students to develop a sense of responsibility through a well-planned academic schedule, extra-curricular activities and sports activities. <br><br>

                        Mayurapade Central College has been recognized as the leading mixed school with the intention of offering value based and quality education to the students in North Western Province for several decades, which has displayed the outstanding performances in the past and prime concern of the school is to integrate the academic and extra-curricular development of the individual, so that the students can effectively contribute culturally, socially, politically, and economically after they leave school. <br><br>

                        Mayurapada was conferred with the Grade 1AB School and it is also a leading National School in Giriulla Education Zone. The school admission mainly focused on year 5 scholars, students are enrolled to grade 6, subjects we offered in the National Language and English Medium for all grades under the national curriculum. The school consists all streams of a secondary school with Science, Technology, Commerce and Arts Streams. At present there are approximately 3200 students with a qualified academic staff of 165 teachers, 2 Deputy Principals qualified in Principal Service and qualified Principal in Sri Lanka Administrative Service obtained Class I. Our Staff members are dedicated to meeting the academic and social needs of our students. I assure that the school management and our team of experienced teachers is doing their best to give the students to the required edge to make his or her future in this global world. <br><br>

                        Mayurapadians is capable, talented, and confident and in caring leader who seeks to be sensitive to the need of others. All the students should ensure your participation in all school activities. Always and in every field, honestly do the best you can and nobody can stop you from being successful.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; Dear students, it is my message to you all that the people of fine character live by their values. They are honest and are committed to truthfulness in thought, word and deed. True character thus compasses the capacity for self-discipline. Every student has a part to play in promoting the school culture, its values and its mission, must cultivates the attributes, the skills and the aspiration to ignite change for a better tomorrow. Establish your school in your heart and in your mind as something of which you can be really proud. <br><br>

                        &nbsp; I would like to pay my gratitude to the past principals, past and present teachers for their dedication and commitment to produce exceptional results in all fields of education and all its students for bringing recognition to the school their achievement, and also thankful for Past Pupils Association and the Parents who walk alongside the school to bring out the best in Mayurapada. <br><br>

                        &nbsp; Today my message to Mayurapadians is to move forward with dignity, to reach your goals, bearing in mind as role model “Mayurapadian” who earned respect of all fora wisdom. <br><br>
